You play as Gilgamesh, a warrior lost in the rift who ends up travelling into different worlds. As a 
weapon collector in search for the legendary weapon “Excalibur”, he aims to travel to different 
worlds to one day come up with that legendary weapon. Armed with extremely powerful 
weapons he has collected during his recent travels, he sets off on a journey to other worlds.

However, he realized that in order for him to do this, he needs money (Gil, in the universe he is 
in) during his travels. He needs money to purchase equipment that he will need during his 
battles, and more importantly, to buy rare weapons that he sets his eyes on. The only 
reasonable way he can obtain money is by earning them in an honest manner, and that is 
through buying and selling goods he purchases from other worlds.

Unfortunately, he does not have much goods to his name, save for his Genji equipment which 
he can sell at the beginning of his journey for a hefty amount. (Or rather, depending on what the 
Merchant of the Rift offers him)

However, he realizes that items that are considered as priceless in different worlds are quite 
common in another world. As a traveler of the rift, he could use this to his advantage to buy low 
from another world and to sell high in another.

As a matter of fact, Gilgamesh did some research of his own and found out that the following 
are items that will help him gain a lot of money, so when he travels to different merchants 
around different worlds, these are the items he will pay attention to.
